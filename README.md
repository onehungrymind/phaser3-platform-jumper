# DRAFT: Phaser 3 Platform Jumper

NOTE: This project is a work in progress and so major pieces of functionality are missing.

This project is the companion project to the [Phaser 3 Platform Jumper Workshop](https://idyllic-torrone-cf0e08.netlify.app/).

## The Inspiration
This project is a 2D jumper game built in Phaser 3 that was heavily influenced by the excellent [HTML5 Games Workshop](https://mozdevs.github.io/html5-games-workshop/en/guides/platformer/start-here/) from [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org/).

With the release of Phaser 3, a significant number of breaking changes were introduced, necessitating a complete rewrite of the game. I am incredibly thankful for the original post, as it was the doorway to my love and appreciation for Phaser.
